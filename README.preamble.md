How to read options from command line, config files, and mix both. With Node and Yargs.

[YARGS](https://github.com/yargs/yargs) is a powerful tool if you're building anything complex with Node. One of the best things is it not only looks at command-line arguments, but config files, and it's even possible to mix them together.

I created this project because I wanted to explore how all of this works. How is a conflicts handled in a situation where the same argument is specified in multiple placs? How does all this work when there are nested hashes (i.e. a hierarchy of options, not just a simple, flat, list). And how to deal with config files flexibly, not just the standard idea of a JSON file at a location specified by the user.

The yargs invocations can be found in the [lib/](lib/) folder. This doc is generated by the bash script `demo.sh`, which runs the scripts with various arguments to demonstrate each usage pattern.
